Here's a concise overview of your web scraping application for the GitHub README file:

# Web Scraping Application

This Python application scrapes article content from given URLs and saves the data as Word documents.

## Purpose

The purpose of this app is to automate the process of extracting key information from online articles, including:

- Title
- Content
- Updated date
- Byline (author)
- Section
- Keywords/tags
- Featured image

It's useful for researchers, journalists, or anyone needing to collect and organize information from multiple web articles efficiently.

## How It Works

1. The app takes one or more URLs as input.
2. For each URL, it:
   - Fetches the HTML content
   - Parses the HTML to extract relevant information
   - Downloads the featured image (if available)
   - Compiles the data into a structured format
3. The extracted data is then saved as a Word document, with one document per article.
4. Multiple URLs are processed concurrently for efficiency.

## Usage
```
Run the script from the command line:

```
python scraper.py [URLs] -o [OUTPUT_DIRECTORY]

```
Example:
```
python scraper.py https://example.com/article1 https://example.com/article2 -o scraped_articles


- `[URLs]`: One or more URLs to scrape (space-separated)
- `-o [OUTPUT_DIRECTORY]`: (Optional) Specify the output directory for the Word documents

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Required libraries: requests, beautifulsoup4, python-docx, unidecode
```
Install dependencies:
```
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 python-docx unidecode


## Note

This scraper is designed for general use but may require adjustments for specific websites. Always ensure you have permission to scrape content from the target websites.
